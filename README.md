# my-project
This project involves the development of a Packet Sniffing Tool designed to monitor and analyze network traffic in real time. The tool captures raw packets from a network interface, decodes protocol headers (such as IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP), and displays meaningful information such as source/destination IP addresses, ports, packet sizes
